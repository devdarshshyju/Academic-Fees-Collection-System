Project Statement: Academic Fees Collection and Admission Cell System
1. Problem Statement
The difficulty faced by academic institutions is relying on manual processes for managing student admissions and tracking course fee payments. This process is time-consuming, prone to human error in calculating outstanding balances, and lacks the capability for generating real-time, comprehensive financial reports.

2. Scope of the Project
The project's scope is strictly limited to developing a console-based application that handles the core administrative workflow: student registration, fee collection, and summary reporting. It utilizes file handling for local data persistence and is intended for use by admission and finance personnel.

3. Target Users
The primary target users are Admission and Finance Cell Operators within an educational institution who require a simple, reliable, and standardized tool to digitize student records and manage financial transactions accurately.

4. High-Level Features
Object-Oriented Data Model: Uses the Student class and AcademicSystem class to ensure structured, modular data management.

Automated Admission: Registers new students and assigns a unique, sequential Admission ID.

Secure Fee Processing: Processes deposits, ensures accurate balance calculation, and includes logic to prevent overpayment.

Data Persistence: Reliable storage and retrieval of all records using a local JSON file.

Financial Reporting: Calculation and display of the overall total fee collected and the total outstanding balance.
